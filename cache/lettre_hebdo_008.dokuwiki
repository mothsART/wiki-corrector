===== Nouvelles générales de la communauté =====

==== Behind Ubuntu: Jani Monoses ====

Le site "Behind Ubuntu" a interviewé Jani Monoses qui est le fondateur de Xubuntu.

==== The Fridge, plugged in again and humming along ====

Les lecteurs de nouvelles fraîches Ubuntu par sa communauté ont peut-être trouvé que [[https://fridge.ubuntu.com/|The Fridge]] avait été placé en hibernation prolongé parce que...

Readers of Ubuntu's premier community-based news may have felt like  [https://fridge.ubuntu.com/ The Fridge] had been put into ''deep freeze'' because of people's commitments being overextended.

Therefore it will be uproariously pleasing that the job of editing The Fridge was [http://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-marketing/2006-July/000727.html
officially handed over] to Jorge and the [http://launchpad.net/people/ubuntu-marketing Ubuntu-Marketing] team, who responded with vigor and soon set up the `#ubuntu-fridge` channel on Freenode (after a short debate about whether `#fridge` or `#ubuntu-fridge` was easier to type)!

With a wiki-based submission method, the news started flowing in, and its effectiveness was soon demonstrated:  Within 48 hours of the announcement, there were enough submissions to fill the entire front page!

Among the first stories to be posted was, of course, one announcing [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuWeeklyNewsletter/Issue7 Issue #7] of the Ubuntu Weekly Newsletter.  We hope to see future issues going up quickly as well!

You can submit your own articles simply by tagging them with [FridgeContent].  They'll be automatically linked to an index of ready material.

==== Did that say Ubuntu? California sees an Ubuntu billboard ====

Ubuntu isn’t just a great way to get more from your computer. Now it’s roadside art!

Eagle-eyed readers may have spotted blog posts with photos of an exceptionally good-looking billboard in the USA. The beige and red, friendly typeface looks incredibly familiar!

==== Ubuntu wins on security ====

A study of the Secunia.com database of Linux security vulnerabilities puts Ubuntu at the top of the Linux security league!

===== Educating Ubuntu users and developers =====

The last few weeks have seen a resurgence in education on various parts of Ubuntu -- not education as a target market but education of the many users and developers of Ubuntu. Both the Ubuntu Classroom, aimed at users, and the MOTU School, aimed at package uploaders, held classes this week.

==== The Ubuntu Classroom launches ====
The New User Network offered its first class on Saturday, August 5, 2006, at 18:00 UTC. The first course helped users with Internet Relay Chat (IRC). The text-based irssi and graphical Konversation IRC clients were covered in this course, and a follow-up course will be offered on Sunday, August 6, 2006, time TBD.

==== The MOTU School teaches bug triaging and patching ====
The 'Masters Of The Universe' have been busy offering some amazing classes. Martin Pitt recently presented an IRC seminar about "How to patch source packages." More information concerning this class as well as the other ones they have done so far can be viewed at the following URLs:

===== The latest and greatest in Edgy (and a bit for 6.06 LTS "Dapper Drake") ==

Daniel Holbach (dholbach), one half of the crazy GNOME uploading team, has been hard at work getting Galago and Telepathy into Edgy. What are these marvelous things, you ask? 

'''Galago''' is a "presence framework" designed to allow easy data access about people and their availablity to applications. This includes such concepts as when writing an email, you can see if that person is online or not, much like GMail does. You can find out more about Galago at its website: https://www.galago-project.org/about.php

'''Telepathy''' is a "unified framework for real-time communication". It is designed to make writing IRC and IM apps easy by abstracting the actual protocol used, be it Jabber, AIM, Yahoo, IRC, etc. You can find out more about Telepathy at its website:
https://telepathy.freedesktop.org/wiki/

Not to be outdone, the always-busy and sadly-not-working-for-Canonical-anymore Jeff Waugh has uploaded Robert Love's latest gift to the world, '''beaglefs''' 1.0.3 . This allows you to take a beagle query and make it into a filesystem, to be mounted just like a CD or a hard drive partition. More information and shiny screenshots can be seen at Robert's blog, http://rlove.org/log/20060721

Jonathan Riddell has also updated Edgy to have '''KDE 3.5.4''', the latest stable point release. Further information can be found at http://kubuntu.org/announcements/kde-354.php and http://dot.kde.org/1154521282/

Other Edgy packages of note are:
  * '''Jokosher''' (''jokosher'')- first package of this new non-linear multitrack audio editor, development headed by Jono Bacon. [http://www.jokosher.org Jokosher website]
  * '''XGL''' - (''xserver-xgl'') Updated to latest CVS by Andrew Mitchell
  * '''Usplash''' (''usplash'') - after much demand, Matthew Garrett has made usplash accept higher resolution SVG images
  * '''Apport''' (''apport'') - Martin Pitt has uploaded intial work on the new crash reporting tool. More information at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CrashReporting
  * '''Desktopsecure''' (''desktopsecure'', only though Add/Remove)- A new addition to the Canonical commercial repository, Desktopsecure is a desktop firewall by Panda. More information at [http://www.pandasoftware.com/products/DesktopSecure the Desktop Secure website]. This software is also available to 6.06 LTS users.

===== Revue de presse =====
==== Ubuntu 6.06 LTS est "recommandé par IT Reviews" ====
IT Reviews a donné à Ubuntu 6.06 LTS son label "Recommandé". Extrait de la revue :

"Ubuntu 6.06 LTS est une distribution Linux très complète et facile d'utilisation, et elle est remarquablement facile à prendre en main en comparaison avec d'autres. Tout ceci fait qu'elle est un bon point de départ pour les nouveaux venus ; mais n'allez cependant pas croire qu'elle est bridée de quelque façon. Même si elle plaît aux fans, Ubuntu est une implémentation complète de Linux avec tout ce qu'il faut pour une utilisation industrielle, y compris les mises à jours automatiques et du support commercial si besoin."

===== Fonctionnalité de la semaine - KDict =====
