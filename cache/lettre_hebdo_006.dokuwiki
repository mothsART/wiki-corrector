==== Merges ====

All the KDE packages in main have been merged and updated to their latest versions.  Most of the packages in universe have also been merged and updated.  Many thanks to the great team of MOTU and soon-to-be-MOTU who have helped with this.  We are now in a freeze while we prepare the first testing CD, Knot 1.

==== New Dapper Packages ====

KOffice 1.5.2 was released with lots of bugfixes and packages are available for Kubuntu Dapper.

http://kubuntu.org/announcements/koffice-152.php

==== Rosetta for KDE ====

The KDE translators had an occasionally heated debate about Rosetta
and the problems of duplicating work.  Most of the issues raised are
due to be sorted out by improvements to Rosetta over the next few months
but if you are using Rosetta it could be useful to contact your
upstream translation teams and see how best to get your work upstream.

===== Edubuntu =====

==== New Edubuntu Community Members ====

This week we welcome new Edubuntu community members, Lisa Savage (Alias Vegas) and Rodrigo Parra Novo (rodarvus)! Unknown by many, Lisa was responsible for the Edubuntu-Young wallpaper that got shipped in Edubuntu 6.06, while Rodrigo is the Technical Lead for Edubuntu and employed by Canonical Ltd. Rodrigo used to work for Conectiva and Nokia and his past experience will definitely make an impact to the next version of Edubuntu due for release in October 2006!

Edubuntu community members are known for their high impact and sustaining contributions to the Edubuntu project, be it on coding or non-coding work. If you would like to be part of the Edubuntu community, join us and have yourself added for consideration at the next Edubuntu Council at https://launchpad.net/people/edubuntu-members.

===== À la une cette semaine - Baobab =====

Ever needed to find out how large an entire directory was, including all the files in all the sub-directories off that directory? That's exactly what Baobab is for.

Baobab is in Ubuntu's Universe repository; install it through Synaptic ('''System->Administration->Synaptic Package Manager''').

Use it by selecting a directory in Nautilus (Gnome's file manager, reachable through '''Places->Home Folder''') then right-clicking and selecting '''Scripts->Open In Baobab''' or by choosing '''Applications->Accessories->Baobab'''.

The image below shows Baobab in action, with Nautilus behind it, both showing the same section of directories & sub-directories.
